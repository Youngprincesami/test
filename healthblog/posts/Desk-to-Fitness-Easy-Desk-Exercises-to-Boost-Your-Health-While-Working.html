          Working
        </h1>

        <p>
          Sitting for long hours can take a toll on your health, but
          incorporating a few desk exercises into your workday can make a big
          difference. These simple moves can improve circulation, reduce muscle
          stiffness, and keep you energized—no gym required! Here are some easy
          exercises you can do right at your desk to stay active and healthy
          while you work.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Seated Leg Raises</h2>
        <p>
          Strengthen your lower body without leaving your chair. Sit up
          straight, extend one leg out in front of you, hold for a few seconds,
          and then lower it back down without touching the floor. Repeat 10-15
          times, then switch to the other leg.
        </p>

        <h3>How It Works:</h3>
        <p>
          This exercise engages your thigh muscles and improves circulation,
          helping to prevent stiffness from prolonged sitting.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Chair Squats</h2>
        <p>
          Stand up from your chair and then slowly lower yourself back down, as
          if you’re about to sit but stopping just before you reach the chair.
          Hold for a few seconds, then stand back up. Repeat 10 times.
        </p>

        <h3>How It Works:</h3>
        <p>
          Chair squats activate your leg and core muscles, improving strength
          and stability while giving you a quick energy boost.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Shoulder Shrugs</h2>
        <p>
          Release tension in your shoulders by lifting them towards your ears,
          holding for a few seconds, and then letting them drop. Repeat 10 times
          to relieve shoulder tightness.
        </p>

        <h3>How It Works:</h3>
        <p>
          Shoulder shrugs ease neck and shoulder tension, which can build up
          from sitting and working at a desk.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Desk Push-Ups</h2>
        <p>
          Place your hands on the edge of your desk, step back, and do a
          push-up. Keep your body straight and bend your elbows, lowering your
          chest toward the desk. Push back up and repeat 10-15 times.
        </p>

        <h3>How It Works:</h3>
        <p>
          Desk push-ups strengthen your arms and chest muscles, helping to
          counteract the effects of sitting all day.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Seated Torso Twist</h2>
        <p>
          Sit up straight, place one hand on the back of your chair, and gently
          twist your torso to one side, holding for a few seconds. Repeat on the
          other side.
        </p>

        <h3>How It Works:</h3>
        <p>
          This stretch relieves lower back tension and improves flexibility in
          your spine, making it easier to maintain good posture.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Ankle Rotations</h2>
        <p>
          Lift one foot off the floor and rotate your ankle in small circles.
          Repeat 10 times in each direction, then switch to the other foot.
        </p>

        <h3>How It Works:</h3>
        <p>
          Ankle rotations improve circulation in your lower legs, reducing the
          risk of swelling from sitting.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          These desk exercises make it easy to stay active and healthy during
          the workday, even when you’re short on time. Give a few of them a try
          each day, and you’ll feel more energized, focused, and less prone to
          stiffness. Remember, small movements can make a big impact on your
          overall health!
