            <h2>Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
            <p>
              Free Fire is known for its fast-paced matches, typically lasting
              around 10 minutes. Players drop onto a vibrant island, gather
              weapons, and engage in combat to be the last one standing. The
              game features a simplified mechanics system, making it accessible
              for newcomers while still offering depth for experienced players.
            </p>

            <p>
              In contrast, Call of Duty (specifically Warzone) incorporates a
              more complex gameplay style. Matches can last longer, with a focus
              on strategy, teamwork, and a variety of weapon customization
              options. Players can engage in a range of combat situations, from
              close-quarters battles to long-range sniping, making for a diverse
              experience.
            </p>

            <h3>Significance</h3>

              thrills that cater to different player preferences.

              gamers.
            </p>

              On the other hand, Call of Duty showcases stunning, realistic
              graphics that enhance the immersion factor. The detailed
              environments and character models create a gritty atmosphere,
              appealing to players who enjoy a more intense and lifelike
              experience.

              In Free Fire, players can customize their characters with a wide
              range of skins, emotes, and outfits. The game frequently updates
              its cosmetics, keeping players engaged with fresh content.
              However, character abilities are limited, focusing more on
              cosmetic differences rather than gameplay impact.
            </p>

            <p>
              Call of Duty offers extensive customization options, allowing
              players to modify their weapons, loadouts, and character skins.
              The game features a detailed progression system, rewarding players
              with new gear and abilities as they level up, which adds depth to

            <p>
              For players who value aesthetic variety and quick updates, Free
              Fire shines, while those who appreciate a comprehensive
              progression system may prefer Call of Duty.
